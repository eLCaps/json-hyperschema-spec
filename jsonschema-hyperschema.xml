                    This example schema defines the properties of the instance.
                    For the "imgData" property, it specifies that that it should be base64-decoded and the resulting binary data treated as a PNG image.
                    It also defines link relations for the instance, with URIs incorporating values from the instance.

                <t>
                    The purpose of this document is to define keywords for the JSON Schema that allow JSON data to be understood as hyper-text.
                </t>
                <t>
                    JSON data on its own requires special knowledge from the client about the format in order to be interpretable as hyper-text.
                    JSON Hyper-schema provides a way to describe a hyper-media interpretation of existing JSON formats, without defining reserved keywords or otherwise restricting the structure of the JSON data.

                            The <xref target="RFC6570">URI Template specification</xref> restricts the set of characters available for variable names.
                            Property names in JSON, however, can be any UTF-8 string.

                            To allow the use of any JSON property name in the template, before using the value of "href" as a URI Template, the following pre-processing rules MUST be applied, in order:

                                The purpose of this step is to allow the use of brackets to percent-encode variable names inside curly brackets.
                                Variable names to be escaped are enclosed within rounded brackets, with the close-rounded-bracket character ")" being escaped as a pair of close-rounded-brackets "))".
                                Since the empty string is not a valid variable name in RFC 6570, an empty pair of brackets is replaced with "%65mpty".

                                After the above substitutions, if the character "$" (dollar sign) appears within a pair of curly brackets, then it MUST be replaced with the text "%73elf" (which is "self" with a percent-encoded "s").

                                The special-case values of "%73elf" and "%65mpty" were chosen because they are unlikely to be accidentally generated by either a human or automated escaping.

                                Schema and API authors should bear this in mind, and use other types (such as string or boolean) if the exact representation is important.

                        This property has similar security concerns to that of "mediaType".
                        Clients MUST NOT use the value of this property to aid in the interpretation of the data received in response to following the link, as this leaves "safe" data open to re-interpretation.

                <t>
                    The value of this property is advisory only, and represents the media type <xref target="RFC2046">RFC 2046</xref>, that is expected to be returned when fetching this resource.
                    This property value MAY be a media range instead, using the same pattern defined in <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 5.3.1 - HTTP "Accept" header</xref>.
                </t>

                <t>
                    This property is analogous to the "type" property of &lt;a&gt; elements in HTML (advisory content type), or the "type" parameter in the <xref target="RFC5988">HTTP Link header</xref>.
                    User agents MAY use this information to inform the interface they present to the user before the link is followed, but this information MUST NOT use this information in the interpretation of the resulting data.
                    When deciding how to interpret data obtained through following this link, the behaviour of user agents MUST be identical regardless of the value of the this property.
                </t>

                <t>
                    If this property's value is specified, and the link's target is to be obtained using any protocol that supports the HTTP/1.1 "Accept" header <xref target="RFC7231">RFC 7231, section 5.3.1</xref>, then user agents MAY use the value of this property to aid in the assembly of that header when making the request to the server.

                    If this property's value is not specified, then the value should be taken to be "application/json".

                        A suitable instance described by this schema would have four links defined.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "self" would have an expected MIME type of "application/json" (the default).
                        The two links with a "rel" value of "alternate" specify the locations of HTML and RSS versions of the current item.
                        The link with a "rel" value of "icon" links to an image, but does not specify the exact format.
                    </postamble>
                </figure>

                <t>
                    A visual user agent displaying the item from the above example might present a button representing an RSS feed, which when pressed passes the target URI (calculated "href" value) to an view more suited to displaying it, such as a news feed aggregator tab.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Note that presenting the link in the above manner, or passing the URI to a news feed aggregator view does not constitute interpretation of the data, but an interpretation of the link.
                    The interpretation of the data itself is performed by the news feed aggregator, which SHOULD reject any data that would not have also been interpreted as a news feed, had it been displayed in the main view.
                </t>

                <section title="Security concerns for &quot;mediaType&quot;">
                    <t>
                        The "mediaType" property in link definitions defines the expected format of the link's target.
                        However, this is advisory only, and MUST NOT be considered authoritative.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        When choosing how to interpret data, the type information provided by the server (or inferred from the filename, or any other usual method) MUST be the only consideration, and the "mediaType" property of the link MUST NOT be used.
                        User agents MAY use this information to determine how they represent the link or where to display it (for example hover-text, opening in a new tab).
                        If user agents decide to pass the link to an external program, they SHOULD first verify that the data is of a type that would normally be passed to that external program.
                    </t>

                    <t>
                        This is to guard against re-interpretation of "safe" data, similar to the precautions for "targetSchema".

            <section title="Submission Link Properties">
                <t>
                    The following properties also apply to Link Description Objects, and provide functionality analogous to HTML forms, in providing a means for submitting extra (often user supplied) information to send to a server.
                </t>

                <section title="method">
                    <t>
                        This property defines which method can be used to access the target resource.
                        In an HTTP environment, this might be "GET" or "POST" (or other HTTP methods).
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Some link relation values imply a set of appropriate HTTP methods to be used for the link.
                        For example, a client might assume that a link with a relation of "edit" can be used in conjuction with the "PUT" HTTP method.
                        If the client does not know which methods might be appropriate, then this SHOULD default to "GET".
                    </t>
                </section>

                <section title="encType">
                    <t>
                        If present, this property indicates a query media type format that the server supports for querying or posting to the collection of instances at the target resource.
                        The query can be suffixed to the target URI to query the collection with property-based constraints on the resources that SHOULD be returned from the server or used to post data to the resource (depending on the method).

                        This property contains a schema which defines the acceptable structure of the submitted request.
                        For a GET request, this schema would define the properties for the query string and for a POST request, this would define the body.
