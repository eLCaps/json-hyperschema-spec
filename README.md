JSON Hyper-Schema is a JSON Schema vocabulary that allows you to annotate, JSON documents with RFC 8288-style web links.  It is typically used with the vocabularies from the JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation specifications.

This repository contains the sources for the **work in progress** of the next set of JSON Hyper-Schema IETF Internet Draft (I-D) documents.
For the latest released I-Ds, please see the [Specification page](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) on the website.

## Contents

We are in the process of splitting the JSON Hyper-Schema specification and meta-schema documents out of the main [json-schema-spec](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec) repository and into this repository.

This is to allow JSON Hyper-Schema, which remains fairly experimental, to develop on a different timeline than the JSON Schema Core and Validation specifications, which are much closer to standardization.

See [the website](https://json-schema.org) for more information on all of the JSON Schema Organization's specifications.

## The website

The JSON Schema (including Hyper-Schema) web site is at [http://json-schema.org/](http://json-schema.org/)

The source for the website is [maintained in a separate repository](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-org.github.io).
